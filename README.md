###require('lx')

O javascript [`meetup`](http://www.meetup.com/require-lx/) in Lisbon, Portugal.

#####Motivations

To date, there has been no group focused on JavaScript in Lisbon - so we decided to create this group!  

We want to share our experiences and discuss challenges we experience when working with JavaScript with the Lisbon JS community in the hope to enable new awesome projects. 

This is completely a community-driven effort - so we need your input and help!  

### Goals 
* Encourage members to participate in open-source JS projects.
* Share workflows, tools, tricks & tips, and experience with frameworks that we use on a daily basis. 
* Foster a local community of JavaScript developers - but also be welcoming to international visitors.  
* Encourage discussion of both "classic" JavaScript environments (i.e., browsers), and also other environments where things like Node.js are making an impact: on servers, Arduinos, and the Raspberry Pi. 

####Get in touch
Use any of the following methods to communicate with us: 

* Make a pull request.
* Open or comment in an issue.
* Submit a talk proposal (prefix with "Talk: ").
* **Discuss** we have an IRC channel `#require('lx')` on `irc.freenode.net`.
* Join the group on [`meetups`](http://www.meetup.com/require-lx/) to receive notification about when we are meeting.
