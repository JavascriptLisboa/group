Venues
======

We are really thankful to all the companies that have been available and that continue available to host require('lx') in their spaces. We understand that hosting groups of 40++ people requires preparation and without them, we couldn't host our meetups.

For the record and to show our appreciation, here is the list of spaces + companies that have been supporting our events with space:

### TÃ©cnico Lisboa (Tagus Park)
